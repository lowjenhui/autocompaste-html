Otters have long, slim bodies and relatively short limbs. Their most striking anatomical features are the powerful webbed feet used to swim, and their seal-like abilities holding breath underwater. Most have sharp claws on their feet and all except the sea otter have long, muscular tails. 

There are 13 still existing otter species are all semiaquatic, aquatic or marine, with diets based on fish and invertebrates. All the 13 different species are either endangered, near threatened and vulnerable. Only the North American River Otter has a stable population trend. (ICUN Otter Specialist Group)
