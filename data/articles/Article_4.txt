Hammerhead sharks are named for the unusual and distinctive structure of their heads, which are flattened and laterally extended into a hammer shape called a cephalofoil. Hammerheads have disproportionately small mouths and seem to do a lot of bottom-hunting. Unlike most sharks, hammerheads usually swim in schools during the day, becoming solitary hunters at night. 

In Singapore, sharks are now rarely seen and occasional sightings still confirm their presence, and it is surprising to note that hammerhead sharks were common in Singapore's past (Tham, 1973b).
