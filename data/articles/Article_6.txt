Sea turtles can be found in all oceans except for the polar regions. They mostly can be found in coral reefs. Leatherback turtles feed almost exclusively on jellyfish. Hawksbills principally eat sponges. The rest of the sea turtles are omnivorous. A sleeping sea turtle can remain underwater for 4â€“7 hours. Sea turtles can not retract their head, legs, and arms into their shells like other turtles.

4 out of 7 species of marine turtles can be found in Singapore. The hawksbill, loggerhead, green turtle and leatherback traverse Singapore seas, feeding, resting and even nesting between their long journeys.
