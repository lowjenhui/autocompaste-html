A dugong's mouth faces downwards to munch on seagrass and it has large, grinding teeth that grow continuously. Its digestive system is also adapted for tackling seagrass. The dugong is the only herbivorous mammal that is strictly marine. 

Sometimes confused with the manatee. The manatee has a circular tail while dugongs have a dolphin-like tail.

Although rarely seen, signs of dugongs are often encountered on our seagrass meadows. Dugongs eat only seagrasses, and thus sometimes called sea cows! They leave a typical feeding trail in the meadows and we have seen fresh trails on Chek Jawa and even mainland shores like Changi. As well as meadows in the south like Pulau Semakau and Cyrene Reef and other submerged reefs.
