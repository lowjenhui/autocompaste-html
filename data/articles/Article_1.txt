Otters have become something of a national obsession in Singapore, to the extent that in early August Singaporeans chose this family, known as the Bishan Ten, as the official emblem of Singapore's 51st year.

Smooth-coated otters are often sighted in Singapore's mangroves, mudflats and coastal areas. The Bishan 10 are the friendliest of the bunch. There are at least 50 otters in Singapore, with families scattered in places such as Punggol, Bishan, Marina Bay, Changi, Kallang and Pasir Ris. Otters have thrived partly due to Singapore's efforts to clean up its water bodies and partly because otters have been forced out of the neighbouring shores of Johor which have undergone development.

When you spot an otter in the evening, you get a proper show. They always seem to follow a similar pattern of behaviour. First they'll catch some fish, and proceed to happily tear them to pieces and devour them, either on the shore or in the water. After dinner, they start to play, chasing each other around in the water - they remind me of a mixture between a dog, a cat and a seal. After about half an hour of this, and just as twilight begins to settle in, they'll scramble up the bank, find a bit of bare earth, and start to roll around until they're coated in fine sand. A bit more frolicking, and then suddenly, just like that, it's time to go - they vanish down into the water, or under a bridge, in the space of a minute or two.
