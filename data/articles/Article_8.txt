Cats enjoy sleeping more than their daily activities of hunting, playing and eating. A domesticated cat sleeps for an average of 13 â€“ 16 hours a day. When cats bump you with the front part of their head - bunting, that is when they are truly showing affection. Cats that roll onto their backs and stretches out in front of you (with their belly area exposed) is saying - I'm happy and secure.

Cats are not allowed in HDB flats. Reasons given by HDB is that they are generally difficult to contain within the flat, shed fur and caterwaul during mating season.
