All the limelight on the smooth-coated otters may lead people to think that there is only one species of otter in Singapore. However, there are in fact two species that can be found here. They are the smooth-coated otters, and the more elusive Asian small-clawed otters. 

They are the smallest otter species in the world. Its paws are a distinctive feature, its claws not extending beyond the fleshy end pads of its partially webbed fingers and toes. This gives it a high degree of manual dexterity so that it can use its paws to feed on molluscs, crabs and other small aquatic animals.

Some states in American such as Missouri allow you to keep river otters as pets. All you need to do is obtain a Wildlife Hobby Permit, and that authorizes you to hold no more than one red or grey fox, coyote, beaver, river otter, Eastern grey squirrel, bobcat, badger, or opossum for personal use.
