There are more than 465 known species of sharks living in our oceans today. Sharks belong to a family of fish that have skeletons made of cartilage, a tissue more flexible and lighter than bone. All sharks have multiple rows of teeth, and while they lose teeth on a regular basis, new teeth continue to grow in and replace those they lose.

The commonly seen sharks on Singapore's shores are the Bamboo sharks and Black tipped reef sharks. Bamboo sharks are sometimes seen by divers at Pulau Hantu. Black tipped reef sharks are sometimes encountered when we visit the Southern submerged reefs at low tide. These sharks appear to hunt fish in low water, thus staying in the shallows at moderate tides or coming in with the tide.
